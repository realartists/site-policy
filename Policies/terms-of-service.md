### The Real Artists Terms of Service
Effective date: October 22, 2017

### A. Definitions
**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms.*

1. The "Agreement" refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the "Terms of Service" or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the Real Artists Privacy Statement, available at [realartists.com/policy/privacy-statement.html](privacy-statement.html)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [realartists.com/policy/index.html](index.html).
2. The "Service" refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by Real Artists.
3. The "Website" refers to Real Artists' website located at [realartists.com](https://realartists.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by Real Artists at or through the Website. It also refers to Real Artists-owned subdomains of realartists.com, such as https://hub.realartists.com/, and to https://shipusercontent.com/.
4. "The User," "You," and "Your" refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the account; or that directs the use of the account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age.
5. "Real Artists," "We," and "Us" refer to Real Artists, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. "Content" refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. "User-Generated Content" is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.

### B. Account Terms
**Short version:** *A human must create your account; and you must be 13 or over; You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.*

#### 1. Required Information
You must link to a valid GitHub account to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid account](#l-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

#### 2. Account Requirements
We have a few simple rules for accounts on Real Artists' Service.

- You must be a human to create an account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted.
- You must be age 13 or older. Real Artists does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s account immediately](#m-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
- Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid organization account may create separate logins for as many users as its subscription allows.
- Overall, the number of Users must not exceed the number of accounts you've ordered from us.

#### 3. User Account Security
You are responsible for keeping your account secure while you use our Service. The content of your account and its security are up to you.

- You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account (even when content is posted by others who have accounts under your account).
- You are responsible for maintaining the security of your linked GitHub account and password. Real Artists cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
- You will promptly [notify Real Artists](mailto:support@realartists.com) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account.
- You can revoke Real Artists' access to your GitHub account at any time in your [personal GitHub account settings](https://github.com/settings/applications) or your [organization account settings](https://github.com/organizations/realartists/settings/oauth_application_policy)

### C. Acceptable Use
**Short version:** *While using the service, you must follow this Acceptable Use Policy, which includes some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations.*

#### 1. Compliance with Laws and Regulations
Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

#### 2. Content Restrictions
You agree that you will not under any circumstances upload, post, host, or transmit any content that:

- is unlawful or promotes unlawful activities;
- is or contains sexually obscene content;
- is libelous, defamatory, or fraudulent;
- contains or installs any active malware or exploits, or uses our platform for exploit delivery (such as part of a command and control system); or
- infringes on any proprietary right of any party, including patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, right of publicity, or other rights.

#### 3. Conduct Restrictions
While using The Services, you agree that you will not under any circumstances:

- harass, abuse, threaten, or incite violence towards any individual or group, including Real Artists employees, officers, and agents, or other Ship Users;
- use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;
- attempt to disrupt or tamper with Real Artists' servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on Real Artists' servers through automated means, or to access Real Artists' Service in ways that exceed your authorization.
- impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with Real Artists, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or
- violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.

#### 4. Services Usage Limits
You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without Real Artists' express written permission.

#### 5. Scraping
Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website (including websocket connections) via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through Ship's API. Please see [Section H](#h-api-terms) for our API Terms. You may not scrape the website for any reason.

You may not scrape Ship for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling Ship users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

#### 6. Privacy
Misuse of Ship Users' Personal Information is prohibited.

Any person, entity, or service collecting data from Real Artists must comply with the [Real Artists Privacy Statement](privacy-statement.html) and [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy), particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the Real Artists Privacy Statement). If you collect any Ship User's Personal Information from GitHub, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from Real Artists, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from Real Artists or Real Artists' Users.

#### 7. Excessive Bandwidth Use
If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other Ship customers, we reserve the right to suspend your account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.

#### 8. User Protection
You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.

### D. User-Generated Content
**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.*

#### 1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content
You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

#### 2. Real Artists May Remove Content
We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Real Artists terms or policies.

#### 3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants
You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own ("Your Content"). If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other Ship Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Real Artists the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers.

#### 4. License Grant to Us
We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant Real Artists the right to sell Your Content or otherwise distribute or use it outside of our provision of the Service.

#### 5. License Grant to Other Users
Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and other contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others.

If post content to a public repository, you grant each User of Ship a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the Ship and GitHub Services and to reproduce Your Content solely on Ship and GitHub as permitted through Ship's and GitHub's functionality.  If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other Ship and GitHub Users.

#### 6. Contributions Under Repository License
Whenever you make a contribution to a repository containing notice of a license, you license your contribution under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license your contribution under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license your contributions under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

#### 7. Moral Rights
You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Real Artists the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

### E. Private Repositories
**Short version:** *You may have access to private repositories. We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.*

#### 1. Control of Private Repositories.
Some accounts, such as paid accounts, may have access to private repositories, which allow the linked GitHub User to control access to Content.

#### 2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories.
Real Artists considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. Real Artists will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care. Real Artists will only request required information from private repositories, such as and pull request templates or issue templates. Any information from private repositories not required to provide the Ship service, such as the changed content in `push` webhook events, is immediately discarded.

#### 3. Access.
Real Artists employees may only access the content of your private repositories in the following situations:

- With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If Real Artists accesses a private repository for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner’s consent and knowledge.
- When access is required for security reasons.

#### 4. Exclusions.
If we have reason to believe the contents of a private repository are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](privacy-statement.html/#how-we-respond-to-compelled-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

### F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy
If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](dmca-takedown-policy.html). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on Ship violates your rights, please contact us via [copyright@realartists.com](mailto:copyright@realartists.com). There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the accounts of [repeat infringers](dmca-takedown-policy.html/#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

### G. Intellectual Property Notice
**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*
